#  House Price Prediction

##  Description
This project builds a **regression model** to predict house prices based on property features such as:
- Area (square feet/meters)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms  

The model helps estimate house prices and can be useful for **real estate agents, property investors, and homeowners**.

##  Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, splitting).  
- Training a **Linear Regression** model.  
- Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.
